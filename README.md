- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Opal
- ðŸ‘€ I do cryptography stuff at Trail of Bits.
- ðŸŒ± I've been working a bit lately on Fiat-Shamir stuff, including a fun paper [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/691) and a transcript enforcement library [here](https://github.com/trailofbits/decree)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me github@opalwright.org
- I'm not great with Rust, but I'm getting better (and it's growing on me)
- You could probably find me on your dinner table or in your kitchen (I'm an old C salt)
